  <H1> Notes from Unit 1</h1> <h2>Basics of the Web-the web, HTML, URLs, HTTP, Web applications</h2><p>WWW-world wide web-collection of HTML docs-hypertext markup language</p><p>-basis for every web page</p>
<p>-the glue that holds everything together</p><p>-videos, text, pics, etc.</p><p>
-hyper links-links-makes the web “web-like”</p><p>
-1990s, 30B pages</p><p>
-Types of files that can be found on the web=plain text, HTML, images, videos, music</p><p>
-HTML-the main type of document on the web</p><h2>Major Pieces-Concepts of the Web-you, your computer+browser, internet, servers – flows in that order and back</h2><p>-HTTP-main protocol of the web.  When someone wants to go to the yahoo site, their computer sends an HTTP request to a server looking for this site.  Then the server finds the correct HTML document and sends it back to your computer over the internet.  On your computer you have to have a web browser (ie, firefox) that can interpret the HTML doc. and then display the contents on your screen. See <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48723444">video1</a> for an explanation.<p>	
-Servers-host files that make up the web</p><p>
-Internet-world’s largest computer network	</p><p>
-Browser-program that runs on your computer to display files found on the web</p><h2>HTML documents are made up of HTML elements. When we write HTML we tell the browser the type of element by the HTML tag we use.</h2>
<b>HTML</b>=hypertext markup language which is made up of:<p> 
-text content-“what you see”</p><p>
-markup-how the content “looks” or how it is arranged</p><p>
-references to other docs-e.g. images and videos</p><p>
-links to other pages</p><p>See<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/m-48724340"> video2</a> for a good explanation.<p>	
HTML editor-www.udacity.com/html-playground-fake test browser</p><p>
Plain text is plain text in HTML.</p><p>  
Markup-to make text look different</p><b>Markup</b>-made of <b>tags and elements</b><p><b>
the element"=<NAME>Contents</NAME>"</p><p>
the tag name=NAME</p><p>
opening tag=<"NAME"></p><p>
closing tag=<"/NAME"></b></p><h2>Summary</h2><p>
1.	Web page is a text document written in a language called HTML.  Web browsers read these documents and then interpret and display them.</p><p>
2.	Coding happens when programmers write text in a language that a computer can understand.  The computer can then follow the instructions the programmer wrote.</p><p>
3.	Computers are stupid. Programmers need to write exactly the way a computer understands aka writing with correct syntax.</p><p>
4.	Programmers can’t remember everything.  Can always look up in google.</p><p>
5.	Basic HTML vocabulary.</p>
<b>Tag</b>-always contained within angled brackets. Most have an opening tag and a closing tag.</p><p>
<b>Void tags</b>-don’t require a closing tag </p><p>
<b>Element</b>-an HTML element refers to everything within a set of opening and closing tags.</p><p><b>Attribute</b>-a property of an HTML element. e.g. to set the HREF attribute of an anchor tag to the Udacity URL, you would write <a href=”www.udacity.com”>URL</a>
